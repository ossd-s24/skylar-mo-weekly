title: Week 14

This week my group continued to work on our current open Pull Requests. We were still having trouble passing some tests that are automated so I created an issue asking for some guidance/advice to pass the tests. Our project uses issues as a communication forum which is why I posted it there instead of messaging one of the main contributors. I am waiting to hear back, but my group is still working on the issue to try and fix it as soon as possible so the requests can be merged. Other than that, we have started to discuss our presentation and we are planning on meeting up extra this week in order to have our work completed in time for the presentation. We are hoping to have these three pull requests merged to show during our presentation. We found a platform to create our presentation with a nice design template to use, and we plan on working on that this week.

As this is our last work week before presentations, I have been reflecting on my experiences throughout this semester and overall I feel as though I have learned more in this course than in some of the computer science major required courses. I think that being able to see the inside of an open source project has helped me understand projects better and I have gotten a better hang of GitHub. I know that I definitely need more practice, but I feel much more prepared to enter the workforce now than I did before.
