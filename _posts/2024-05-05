This week was the final week of class leading up to our presentation date. I met up with my team outside of class to create our presentation, and we were able to finish it and do a run through of the presentation online. Overall I had a really great time being in this class, and I learned a lot mroe about the software industry than I have in my other courses. I'm very grateful for this experience and I feel mroe confident joining the workforce with these new skills and knolwedge. I also have to say that this was my favorite experience working in a group at NYU, my teammates were great to work with and even thouhg our projec thad some challenges, it was a positive experience. I hope to find time in the future to contribute to open source, and to continue to learn about different projects happening around me. 

I also enjoyed watching the presentation of my other classmates as I was able to see how their porjects went and what challenges they had to overcome throughout the semester. It was also interesting to see the variety of projects people had chosen to work on and it excites me to learn more about the possibilities of open source.
